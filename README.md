# Go Error Handling with Empty Slice

This repository demonstrates a common error in Go: not properly handling potential errors when working with slices.  The original `myFunc` function correctly checks for an empty slice and returns an error, but it lacks robustness if calculations within the loop might fail (e.g., potential overflow). The improved version demonstrates best practices in error handling.

## Bug Description

The `bug.go` file shows a function `myFunc` that sums up integers in a slice. It handles the empty slice case correctly, but it does not account for potential issues like integer overflow during the summation process.  This can lead to unexpected or incorrect results, with no clear indication of the error.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.go` file demonstrates a more robust implementation that uses error handling to address potential issues during summation. It checks for potential overflow and provides more informative error messages if necessary. This showcases how to handle various scenarios and maintain the integrity of the function's output.
